🪖 Character Design: Finnish–Swedish Infantry Soldier (1808 Regiment)

Style:
DC Comics realism — muscular but grounded anatomy, weathered faces, dynamic battlefield posture. Realistic materials: wool, brass, leather, and snow textures. Bold ink lines with cinematic lighting and drifting smoke for atmosphere.

⚔️ Facial Features
- Northern European features: strong jawline, slightly rugged from campaign wear.
- Determined or weary expression — hardened by battle and cold.
- Short or medium-length light brown or dark blond hair (windswept).
- Pale winter skin tone with windburned cheeks.
- Optional stubble or faint beard shadow.

🎖️ Uniform & Equipment
- Based on Österbottens Regiment (from reference photos):
  - Coat: dark blue-gray with pale yellow or beige facings.
  - Collar & cuffs: contrasting yellow or off-white.
  - Buttons: brass, occasionally tarnished.
  - Straps: off-white cross-belts across chest for cartridge box and bayonet.
  - Trousers: light gray or off-white wool.
  - Boots: tall black leather, weathered with frost.
- Headgear: black shako or side cap depending on rank; may include fur lining or cover for winter.
- Weapon: flintlock musket or drawn sabre, depending on action scene.
- Accessories: cartridge pouch, bayonet, rolled blanket or haversack.
- Environmental detail: light snow dust, mud, or soot on uniform for realism.

🧣 Scarf / Personal Mark
- Black scarf wrapped snugly at the neck — matches von Döbeln’s black scarf style for unit consistency.
- Moves naturally in the wind, showing folds and soft light reflections.

⚡ Pose & Motion
- DC-style action poses — powerful yet realistic.
  1. Advancing: musket at the ready, coat tails flying, snow kicked up.
  2. Reloading: focused expression, smoke curling from barrel.
  3. Charging: mouth open mid-shout, bayonet forward, background blur for energy.
  4. Holding the line: steady stance, slight crouch, musket braced.
  5. Aftermath: kneeling among fallen comrades, silent resolve.

💡 Lighting & Mood
- Lighting: cold northern daylight with warm highlights from musket flashes or burning farmhouses.
- Mood options:
  - Heroic: clear composition, light behind the soldier’s silhouette.
  - Tragic: long shadows, drifting snow obscuring faces.
  - Determined: mid-battle focus, contrasting light across face and scarf.
- Effects: drifting smoke, snowflakes, glint of brass buttons, breath mist in cold air.

🌫️ Atmosphere
- Background: frozen battlefield, pine forest edge, snowstorm, or burning village.
- Ground: uneven snow with footprints and debris.
- Optional comrades or horses blurred in depth for cinematic focus.

🎭 Expression Variants
1. In battle: grit teeth, eyes wide with resolve, snow streaked on face.
2. Commanding: yelling orders, one arm raised, musket angled upward.
3. Wounded: hand clutching shoulder, scarf and snow flecked with blood.
4. Reflective: standing still, looking toward horizon or fallen banner.
