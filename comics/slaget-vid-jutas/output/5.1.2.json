  "description": "Von Döbeln charges forward on horseback through the smoke, sword raised high. His black headscarf and flowing coat create a dark silhouette framed by a glowing halo of battle light. Soldiers follow behind him, partially obscured by smoke. Dramatic DC Comics composition — diagonal motion, bold inks, and chiaroscuro lighting emphasizing leadership and resolve.",
