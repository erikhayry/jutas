  "description": "Interior of the small Nykarleby house. Von Döbeln lies in bed, pale and feverish, yet alert. Papers, maps, and a candle flicker on a nearby table. Shadows stretch across the wooden walls. The mood is tense but focused — classic DC chiaroscuro lighting, warm highlights against cold blue-grey tones.",
  "narration": "Major General Georg Carl von Döbeln — feverish, wounded, yet commanding."
