  "description": "Russian soldiers retreat through the smoke-filled field as the sun sets in the hazy sky. Silhouettes fade into the distance, weapons dropped and flags lowered. The atmosphere is thick with dust and gunpowder residue. DC Comics realism — deep shadows, glowing orange horizon, and cold blue-gray contrast symbolizing victory and exhaustion.",
  "narration": "By dusk, Jutas was theirs. The victory saved the army’s retreat toward Vasa.",
  "quotes": "‘Och segerns ära sken kring hans bleka gestalt.’"
