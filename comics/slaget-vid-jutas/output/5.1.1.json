  "description": "The battle ignites — musket fire erupts across the Jutas field. Thick smoke clouds the air as sparks flash from the barrels. Soldiers fire from behind cover; motion lines and debris add intensity. Classic DC Comics battle realism with chiaroscuro light and swirling powder smoke, cold blues and fiery oranges clashing in the frame.",
  "narration": "At noon, the first volleys burst. The air thick with powder."
