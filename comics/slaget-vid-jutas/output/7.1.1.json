  "description": "The battlefield at dusk lies silent. Smoke drifts across fallen soldiers and broken weapons. The light fades into cold blue and grey hues, with long shadows stretching over the ground. DC Comics somber realism — subdued palette, soft chiaroscuro, and a tone of heavy stillness after the clash.",
  "narration": "Night fell over Jutas. The victory was costly."
