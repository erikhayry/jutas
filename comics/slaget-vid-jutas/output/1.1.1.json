  "description": "Overhead map of Northern Europe (1808–1809) showing Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Red and blue troop arrows mark movement on parchment texture with frost overlay and candlelight glow from one corner. Classic DC Comics realism — bold inks, chiaroscuro lighting, muted cold blues, greys, and golden accents. Full-page splash without characters; title 'SLAGET VID JUTAS' in golden serif lettering.",
  "narration": "In 1808, war broke out between Sweden and Russia. The struggle for Finland had begun. Villages burned, armies marched through snow and forest. What was once Swedish Finland stood alone against the Empire of the Tsar. This is the story of courage and defiance — at Jutas."
