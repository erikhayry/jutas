  "description": "Finnish troops take defensive positions behind fences and ridges. Soldiers crouch with muskets ready, faces focused under the dim morning light. Layered composition shows fence in foreground, troops mid-ground, and misty trees beyond. Strong DC Comics realism with chiaroscuro depth and muted cold hues.",
  "narration": "Cronstedt’s men secure their ground, while Döbeln’s detachment moves to outflank."
