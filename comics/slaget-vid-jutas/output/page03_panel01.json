  "description": "Exterior of a small wooden house in Nykarleby under pale grey morning light. A soldier stands guard outside while a horse waits tethered by the fence. The setting is quiet, with mist lifting from the ground. Rendered in DC Comics realism â€” crisp ink lines, muted cool palette, chiaroscuro shadows conveying resolve and stillness.",
  "narration": "In a modest house in Nykarleby, the commander lies ill but unyielding."
