  "description": "Calm rural landscape near Nykarleby at dawn. Fields and a faint river stretch under a thin layer of mist. Early morning light reveals soft blue and golden hues. Style follows classic DC Comics realism â€” clean composition, muted tones, subtle chiaroscuro. No visible figures; atmosphere of quiet anticipation.",
  "narration": "September 13, 1808. The small village of Jutas near Nykarleby becomes the stage for a decisive encounter."
