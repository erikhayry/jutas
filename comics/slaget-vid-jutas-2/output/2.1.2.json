  "description": "Finnish troops prepare defensive positions along a rural road and river near Nykarleby. Soldiers in blue-gray coats and brass buttons take cover behind fences and rocks. Mist lingers over the field. The tone is calm but tense — chiaroscuro lighting with golden sunrise through fog. DC Comics realism with layered depth and dynamic posture.",
  "narration": "Swedish-Finnish forces, under Colonel Cronstedt, await the Russians advancing from the south."
